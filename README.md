# Dashboard

Bitcoin Investment Decision Support Dashboard
Project Overview
Aim
The goal of this project is to create a dashboard that provides comprehensive insights into Bitcoin's price trends, market sentiment, and key influencing factors. By centralizing predictive analytics, significant event tracking, wallet activity, and sentiment analysis, this dashboard is designed to assist users in making informed investment decisions within the highly volatile Bitcoin market.
Key Components
1.	Bitcoin Price Prediction:
o	A graph showing historical Bitcoin price data alongside a machine-learning-based time series forecast of future prices.
2.	Event Tracker:
o	A timeline of key events (e.g., Bitcoin halving, ETF approvals, Federal Reserve rate changes, global liquidity shifts) that may indirectly influence Bitcoin’s price movement.
3.	Wallet Activity Tracker:
o	Insights into wallet activity, with a focus on large and prominent wallets that could influence market trends.
4.	Sentiment Analysis:
o	Analysis of sentiment from Bitcoin-related news and forums to gauge market mood and potential price direction.
Data Sources
•	Price Data: Yahoo Finance for historical Bitcoin prices.
•	Blockchain Data: Block/blockchain explorer for wallet and transaction activity.
•	Events and News: Various economic, finance, and Bitcoin-related news sources.
•	Machine Learning Library: Scikit-learn for modeling Bitcoin price predictions.

Project Structure
1.	Data Collection:
o	Fetch historical price data and relevant events.
o	Aggregate wallet activity data.
o	Collect recent forum posts and news articles related to Bitcoin.
2.	Data Processing:
o	Clean and preprocess all collected data.
o	Engineer features for price prediction, such as moving averages, trading volumes, and recent price trends.
o	Extract keywords, sentiment scores, and relevant entities from text data in forums and news.
3.	Machine Learning Models:
o	Develop a time series forecasting model using Scikit-learn for Bitcoin price prediction.
o	Implement a sentiment analysis model to classify positive, negative, or neutral sentiments.
4.	Dashboard Components:
o	Bitcoin Price Prediction Graph: Visualize past prices and predictions.
o	Event Tracker: Display significant events that may affect Bitcoin’s price.
o	Wallet Activity Tracker: Show trends in wallet activity, especially among large wallets.
o	Sentiment Analysis Display: Track sentiment from forums and news.

10-Day Project Timeline
Day	Task

Day 1	Set up Project Environment: Set up Python environment, install necessary libraries, and gather data source APIs. Familiarize yourself with the data structure and requirements.

Day 2	Data Collection for Historical Prices and Event Tracker: Fetch and clean historical Bitcoin price data from Yahoo Finance. Start gathering event data for significant Bitcoin events (e.g., halving events, ETF approvals, Federal Reserve rate changes).

Day 3	Feature Engineering for Price Prediction Model: Develop time-series features such as moving averages, recent price trends, trading volumes, and other relevant indicators.

Day 4	Model Training for Price Prediction: Use Scikit-learn to train a time series model for Bitcoin price prediction. Evaluate the initial performance of the model using historical data.

Day 5	Wallet Activity Tracker Data Collection: Set up a data collection pipeline for tracking blockchain wallet activity and identifying large transactions using a blockchain explorer API.

Day 6	Sentiment Data Collection and Preprocessing: Collect forum and news articles related to Bitcoin. Preprocess text data for sentiment analysis (e.g., tokenization, removal of stop words).

Day 7	Sentiment Analysis Model Development: Implement a sentiment analysis model to classify collected text data as positive, neutral, or negative. Test and validate model accuracy.

Day 8	Dashboard Development - Price Prediction and Event Tracker: Begin building the dashboard, integrating the price prediction graph and event tracker components.

Day 9	Dashboard Development - Wallet Tracker and Sentiment Analysis: Add the wallet activity tracker and sentiment analysis to the dashboard. Ensure that each component is functional and visually intuitive.

Day 10	Final Testing and Documentation: Test the dashboard’s performance, validate data accuracy, and ensure all components are correctly visualized. Write documentation and instructions for end-users.


Getting Started
1.	Clone the Repository: Clone this repository and set up your environment with required packages.
